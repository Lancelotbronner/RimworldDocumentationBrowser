# Rimworld Documentation Browser

This is a very simple macOS/iOS application to view the results of the [extractor tool][].

This is currently in development as I'm still working on improving the application's available information and improving the underlying analysis format.

## Roadmap

I don't have much of a roadmap, this is mostly just to see the analysis results and an excuse to try the WWDC23 SwiftUI features. I'd like a cross-platform viewer for these. More information in the [extractor tool][]'s roadmap.
