To defeat them, you must prepare before they happen.\r\n\\nThese design elements can help reduce the damage from fires:\r\n\\n1. Instead of constructing one super-building, build separate buildings with spaces in between.\r\n\\n2. Use less flammable materials. Wood is cheap and fast - but very flammable.\r\n\\n3. Build firebreaks to stop wildfires approaching your base. A strip of concrete floor 3 or 4 cells wide will generally stop an advancing fire.","History tab","You can see a record of your colony\u0027s fortunes over time in the HISTORY tab at the bottom of the screen.","Clicking messages","You can click on the notifications in the top-left of the screen to instantly center the camera on their subject.","Shot accuracy tooltip","You can see the exact calculations behind the accuracy of any shot.\\n\\nTo do so, select the shooter, then rest the mouse over the target. The tooltip will show the chance to hit, and a breakdown of the contribution of various to-hit chance multipliers.","Friendly fire safety","Friendly fire never occurs if the shooter is close to their ally.\\n\\nFor example, you can safely put a sword-wielding colonist directly in front of a gun-wielding one. The shooter will fire over their friend\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\nThis is a good way to combine ranged and melee fighters.","Trade goods and trade beacons","Arresting worsens faction relations","Warning: The person you are trying to arrest may not go quietly.\\n\\nIf you arrest a non-colonist or a colonist from another faction, their entire faction may become your enemy. \\n\\nThis arrest has a {0} chance of succeeding, based on the social skill of the arrester.","Flick designations only designate","Note: This only designates that a colonist should flick the switch.\\n\\nNothing will actually happen until a colonist comes and flicks the switch by hand.","Maximum number of player colonies","Warning: RimWorld is designed to be played with one player colony at a time.
